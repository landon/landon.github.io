        <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">This article is about coloring countries on a map so
            that adjacent countries receive distinct colors. It was
            conjectured in 1852 that any map could be colored thusly using only 4 colors. This was finally
            proved in 1976,
            but the proof is not human-checkable; it requires many hours of computer time to check thousands
            of cases.
            Finding a human-checkable proof is still an open problem. To prove that 5 colors suffice is
            relatively simple. We
            gave a human-checkable proof that 4.5 colors suffice; this means that we get to use 9 colors,
            but have to assign
            each country 2 colors.

        <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">Three gods A, B, and C are called, in no particular
            order, True, False, and Random. True always speaks truly,
            False always speaks falsely, but whether Random speaks truly or falsely is a completely random
            matter. Your
            task is to determine the identities of A, B, and C by asking three yes-no questions; each
            question must be put to
            exactly one god. The gods understand English, but will answer all questions in their own
            language, in which the
            words for yes and no are da and ja, in some order. You do not know which word means which.

        idea of the type of math i tend to work on.
