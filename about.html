    <h2 class="major">About</h2>
    as a child, i was obsessed with machine intelligence. i coded a strong chess AI (codenamed
    Betsy) and experimented with using
    neural networks in Betsy, both for the static evaluation at leaf nodes and within the tree for pruning.
    the networks learned from self-play to get
    about as good as my hand-tuned functions (discounting the slowdown incurred by sigmoid evaluation). i
    concluded that to do better, i would need
    to use raw game state data instead of the set of features i preselected as network inputs;
    unfortunately, this was 2000 and i did not have nearly
    enough processing power to do so.
    <br><br>
    to avoid spinning my wheels while waiting for faster hardware, i decided to put my machine intelligence
    ambitions on hold and study mathematics instead.
    my first year as a math major was spent abroad at utrecht university in the netherlands. my dutch was
    pretty poor, but luckily all the math textbooks
    were in english. learning to learn from just a textbook was painful at first, but this method of
    learning has been indispensable ever since.
    <br><br>
    in 2005 i felt the pull of making real things and left my math phd program (where i was researching fun
    things like quantum groups) to work
    for a defense contractor. we simulated nuclear weapons effects like damage caused to hardware by
    electromagnetic pulse. this work was interesting,
    but for family reasons, after about a year, i moved to colorado and took a job for a subsidiary of
    goldman sachs.
    <br><br>
    the goldman sachs job was not particularly exciting and i had lots of downtime. i had just read the book
    <i>the man who loved only numbers</i> about paul erdős;
    a homeless math genius that traveled around for decades to work on hard problems with other discrete
    mathematicians. i decided to use my work downtime to
    teach myself graph theory and see if i was smart enough to play with these discrete mathematicians. this
    was in 2007, it took three years and a lot more than
    just my work downtime, but in 2010 i made a breakthrough, <a target="_blank"
        href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jctb.2011.05.003">proving</a> a conjecture of two prominent graph
    theorists (alexandr kostochka and hal kierstead). i made
    arrangements with kierstead to come out to arizona state and finish my phd.
    <br><br>
    now it is 2019, i have satisfied my curiosity about playing with erdős's friends and achieved the best
    possible erdős number of 2 (since erdős no longer lives).
    neural networks are all over the news, now called <i>deep learning</i>, researchers are having great
    success; hardware is now fast enough and there are massive
    amounts of data to play with. it is past time for me to get back to my childhood obsession.
